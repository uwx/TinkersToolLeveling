- Fixed broken ClientProxy
- Made weapon XP be awarded on damage instead of on kill; this removes a lot of nightmarish code as it had to track entity->player->tool->damage
- Chime sound on level up isn't working yet, don't know why
- Changed a lot of config systems to be more streamlined
- It's not balanced, every level gives you an upgrade to every slot
